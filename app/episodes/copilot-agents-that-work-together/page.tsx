      introduction="In this episode of Return on Intelligence, Abram and I dive into Microsoft's groundbreaking AI agent developments that are revolutionizing workplace productivity. Fresh from the MVP Summit in Seattle, Abram shares exclusive insights on Microsoft's vision for Copilot's new Researcher and Analyst agents."
      showNotes={[
        "We explored Abram's experience at the recent MVP Summit in Seattle, where he gained insights into Microsoft's long-term vision. The heart of our discussion focused on Microsoft's new Researcher and Analyst agents for Copilot, which represent a fundamental shift in AI interaction patternsâ€”moving from simple chat interfaces to a 'set up a task and let it work' approach that saves hours of effort.",
        "We discussed how Researcher connects with your entire Microsoft 365 ecosystem and can even interact with other agents, creating true multi-agent functionality. Meanwhile, Analyst focuses on structured data analysis across various formats using Python code interpreter capabilities.",
        "We wrapped up by exploring the future of image generation in workplace tools, with Abram sharing how he's creating custom 'style agents' that maintain visual consistency across all content types."
